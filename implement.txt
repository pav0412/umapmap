Number Theory feature engineering 
  feature engineering to distinguish different numbers 

All helper funcs :
  isprime
  first k primes 
  disctinct factors 
  all factors 
  fast modulo 
  fast log divisor 
  euler totient 
  all relative primes 
  all twin primes 
  vectorize 

Encoding 1: Prime Factorization 
  In : K, N 
  for n in range N
      n = prime factorization w/ powers for all k in K 
      vec = all prime factors listed out as many times as powers 
      pass vec to umap 

Encoding 1.5: Disctinct Factors 
  In : K, N 

  for n in range N
      n = prime factorization w/o powers for all k in K 
      vec = all prime factors listed out without all powers 
      pass vec to umap 

Encoding 2: Residues 
  In: K, N 
  for n in range N:
      for k in range K:
        vec.append(n mod k)

Encoding 3: Number Properties 
  In: N 
  for n in range N:
    vec = [log(n), div_count(n), sumofdiv(n), eulertotient(n), totalprimefactors(n) #counts repeats, distinctprimefactors(n)]

is maps or arrays better ? stick with arrays for now because numpy + numbajit
